---

### Introduction (100-150 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] State the key consensus finding or most surprising insight from the experts in the first sentence. Do not begin with "We reached out to experts..." — lead with the value.

**Structure:**
1. **Key finding** (1-2 sentences): The single most important takeaway from across all expert responses — what is the through-line?
   - [STAT: supporting data point that frames why this topic matters now]
2. **Why expert perspectives matter** (1-2 sentences): What do these practitioners know that generalist articles miss?
3. **Preview of diversity** (1-2 sentences): Highlight the range of perspectives — "From [context A] to [context B], these experts bring [X years] of combined experience"
4. **What the reader will get** (1 sentence): Set expectations for actionable takeaways

[INFO-GAIN: unique analysis] Your editorial synthesis is what makes this more than a list of quotes. Signal early that you have analyzed and organized these perspectives into actionable themes.

[INTERNAL-LINK] Link to your pillar page or foundational article on this topic to give readers who need background a place to start.

---

### Expert Sections (5-8 experts, 150-200 words each)

Each expert gets their own H2 section. Order experts strategically — lead with the most recognizable name or the most compelling insight, not alphabetically.

**For each expert section, use this structure:**

```
## [Expert Full Name], [Title] at [Company/Organization]
```

[IMAGE] Expert headshot (with permission). Alt text: "[Expert Name], [Title] at [Company]."

**Structure per section:**

1. **Expert context** (1 sentence): Brief credential or context that establishes why this person's perspective matters for this specific topic. Do not copy their full bio — focus on the relevant qualification.

2. **Key insight** (direct quote, 2-4 sentences): The expert's core advice or perspective in their own words. Direct quotes are strongly preferred over paraphrasing.

```
> "[Direct quote from the expert providing their key insight or strategy.]"
```

3. **Your analysis** (3-5 sentences): This is where YOU add value. Do not just present the quote — analyze it:
   - What makes this advice noteworthy or different from conventional wisdom?
   - How does this connect to or contrast with what other experts in this roundup said?
   - What is the practical implication for the reader?
   - When might this advice be especially relevant (or not apply)?

[INFO-GAIN: unique analysis] Your editorial analysis between quotes is what differentiates a valuable roundup from a lazy quote dump. Each analysis paragraph should contain at least one original observation.

[STAT: supporting data] Where possible, include a statistic that supports or contextualizes the expert's claim.

[INTERNAL-LINK] Link to relevant how-to guides, tools, or articles that help the reader implement the expert's advice.

**Repeat this structure for each of the 5-8 expert sections.**

---

### Synthesis: What the Experts Agree On (200-300 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] State the strongest area of consensus in the first sentence. This section is where your editorial voice matters most.

**Structure:**
1. **Common themes** (100-150 words): Identify 3-4 themes that emerged across multiple expert responses. For each theme:
   - Name the theme (H3 or bold)
   - Note which experts align on this theme
   - Explain why this consensus matters

```
**Theme 1: [Theme Name]**
[Expert A], [Expert B], and [Expert C] all emphasized [specific commonality]. This suggests that [insight about why this consensus exists and what it means for practitioners].

**Theme 2: [Theme Name]**
[Describe the second area of agreement and its implications.]

**Theme 3: [Theme Name]**
[Describe the third area of agreement and its implications.]
```

2. **Contrasting opinions** (50-75 words): Where did experts disagree? Highlight 1-2 areas of divergence and explain what accounts for the different perspectives (different contexts, industries, experience levels, etc.)

3. **What consensus tells us** (50-75 words): Step back and offer a meta-observation — what does the overall pattern of agreement and disagreement reveal about the current state of this topic?
   - [STAT: data point that supports the consensus finding]

[INFO-GAIN: unique analysis] The synthesis is your original contribution. Anyone can collect quotes — your ability to identify patterns and draw non-obvious conclusions is the information gain.

[VISUAL: chart-type] Consider a simple visualization of expert consensus — a matrix showing which experts agree on which themes, a spectrum chart showing the range of opinions, or a Venn diagram of overlapping advice.

### Actionable Takeaways (150-200 words)

1. **[Action verb] [specific advice]** — Based on [Expert Name]'s insight about [topic]. [One sentence expanding on how to implement this.]

- Link to resources where appropriate (use affiliate links with disclosure if applicable)

[INTERNAL-LINK] Link to your own tool reviews or resource guides where relevant.

---

### FAQ (3-5 questions)

[FAQ] Source questions from the types of follow-up questions readers would have after reading expert advice.

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on implementation questions ("How do I start?") and clarification questions ("Does this apply to [my situation]?")
- Each answer should be 40-80 words and lead with a direct answer
- Reference specific experts when relevant

```
### How do I choose which expert advice to follow first?

### Methodology (100 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] State the expert selection criteria in the first sentence to establish the roundup's credibility.

**Structure:**
1. **Selection criteria** (1-2 sentences): How and why these specific experts were chosen (e.g., minimum years of experience, specific domain expertise, practitioner vs. theorist, diversity of perspective)
2. **Outreach method** (1 sentence): How experts were contacted (email interviews, video calls, published statements, conference talks)
3. **Response handling** (1 sentence): Were quotes edited for clarity? Were responses reviewed by experts before publication?
4. **Transparency** (1 sentence): Note any experts who were invited but declined, or any potential conflicts of interest

**Guidelines:**
- This section builds trust — be transparent about your process
- If you sourced quotes from published materials (conference talks, podcasts, articles) rather than direct outreach, say so
- Keep it factual and brief — this is not the place for editorial commentary
