# Template: Data Research (Original Data Study)

**Template ID:** data-research
**Target Length:** 2,000-3,000 words
**Content Type:** Original data study with visualizations and actionable findings
**Primary Search Intent:** Informational ("study," "data," "statistics," "research," "benchmark")

## When to Use This Template

Use this template when:
- You have original data from surveys, experiments, tool analysis, or proprietary sources
- The study reveals findings that challenge assumptions or fill knowledge gaps
- You can present specific numbers, percentages, and comparisons
- Search queries include "statistics," "data," "study," "research," "benchmark," "how many"
- The data is unique enough that other sites will want to cite it (link-building potential)

Do NOT use this template for:
- Step-by-step instructions (use tutorial)
- Timely event commentary (use news-analysis)
- Reference/FAQ content (use faq-knowledge)
- Analysis based entirely on someone else's data (write a news-analysis instead)

**Value Note:** This is the highest-value template for AI citations and backlinks. Original data is a top-tier information gain signal. Invest extra time in methodology and visualization quality.

## Title Format

```
[Study Title]: We Analyzed [N] [Things] — Here's What We Found
```

**Examples:**
- "AI Code Review Study: We Analyzed 10,000 Pull Requests — Here's What We Found"
- "Blog SEO Benchmark: We Analyzed 500 Technical Blogs — Here's What We Found"
- "Developer Tooling Survey: We Asked 2,000 Engineers — Here's What We Found"

**Title Rules:**
- Include the specific sample size (N) — this is your credibility signal
- Name what was analyzed (pull requests, blogs, engineers, etc.)
- "We Analyzed/Studied/Surveyed" establishes original research
- "Here's What We Found" signals actionable insights
- Keep under 70 characters for SERP display when possible

**Alternative Title Formats:**
- "[N] [Things] Analyzed: [Key Finding] ([Year] Study)"

## Section-by-Section Structure

---

### TL;DR Box (60 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Present the 3 most important findings as headline-style data points. Every sentence should contain a number.

```markdown
> **TL;DR:** We analyzed [N] [things] and found [Finding 1 with specific number].
> [Finding 2 with specific number]. Most surprisingly, [Finding 3 with specific number].
> [One-sentence implication for the reader].
```

**Rules:**
- Every sentence must contain a data point (number, percentage, comparison)
- Lead with the most surprising or impactful finding
- Include "most surprisingly" or equivalent to hook readers
- This box will be the most-cited part of the study — make it quotable

---

### Key Findings (200-300 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Present 5-7 headline findings as bullet points. Each bullet is a self-contained, citable data point.

```markdown
## Key Findings

[ANSWER-FIRST] Our analysis of [N] [things] over [time period] revealed [N] key patterns.

[VISUAL: horizontal-bar chart showing the top 5-7 findings ranked by magnitude or importance]

1. **[Finding as a stat]:** [One sentence of context]. ([N]% of [sample])
2. **[Finding as a stat]:** [One sentence of context]. ([N]% of [sample])
3. **[Finding as a stat]:** [One sentence of context]. ([N]% of [sample])
4. **[Finding as a stat]:** [One sentence of context]. ([N]% of [sample])
5. **[Finding as a stat]:** [One sentence of context]. ([N]% of [sample])
6. **[Finding as a stat]:** [One sentence of context]. ([N]% of [sample])
7. **[Finding as a stat]:** [One sentence of context]. ([N]% of [sample])
```

**Rules:**
- Each bullet must be self-contained — citable without context
- Bold the data point, follow with one sentence of context
- Order by magnitude of impact or surprise, not by study order
- Include the visual chart immediately — readers want the overview first

---

### Methodology (200-300 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] State exactly what you studied, how you studied it, and why the reader should trust the results.

```markdown
## Methodology

[ANSWER-FIRST] We analyzed [N] [things] collected from [source] between [start date] and [end date] using [analysis approach].

### Data Source

[Where the data came from, how it was collected, any selection criteria]

[INFO-GAIN: proprietary data source or unique collection method — this is what makes the study unreproducible and therefore valuable]

### Sample

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Sample size | [N] |
| Time period | [Start] to [End] |
| Source | [Where from] |
| Selection criteria | [How items were chosen] |
| Exclusions | [What was filtered out and why] |

### Analysis Approach

[1-2 paragraphs on how the data was analyzed — tools used, statistical methods, categorization approach]

### Limitations

- [Limitation 1]: [How it might affect findings]
- [Limitation 2]: [How it might affect findings]
- [Limitation 3]: [How it might affect findings]
```

**Rules:**
- Be transparent about limitations — this builds credibility
- The [INFO-GAIN] here is your unique data source or method
- Include enough detail that another researcher could evaluate (not necessarily reproduce) the study
- State exclusion criteria explicitly — readers will ask about selection bias

---

### Finding Sections (300-400 words each, 4 findings)

Each finding is an H2 phrased as a question. Follow this structure for each:

```markdown
## [Finding as a Question]?

[ANSWER-FIRST] [State the finding as a specific statistic in the opening sentence. E.g., "78% of technical blogs that rank on page one use..."]

[2-3 paragraphs of detailed analysis:]

**The data:**

[VISUAL: chart appropriate to the finding — vary chart types across findings]

Suggested chart types per finding:
- Finding 1: Horizontal bar chart (comparison)
- Finding 2: Line chart (trend over time)
- Finding 3: Scatter plot (correlation)
- Finding 4: Stacked bar chart (composition)

**What this means:** [Interpretation of the data — what pattern does this reveal?]

**How this compares:** [Comparison to industry benchmarks, prior research, or conventional wisdom]

| This Study | Industry Benchmark | Difference |
|------------|--------------------|------------|
| [Our finding] | [Benchmark] | [Delta] |

[STAT: supporting data point from an external source that validates or contrasts with the finding]

**Practical implication:** [What should the reader do differently based on this finding?]

[INTERNAL-LINK: link to content that helps the reader act on this finding]
```

**Rules for finding sections:**
- Always open with the data point — never bury the lead
- Each finding must have its own visualization (vary chart types)
- Compare to a benchmark or prior research for context
- End with a practical implication — "so what?" for the reader
- Vary chart types across findings — don't use the same chart 4 times

### Surprises & Outliers (150-200 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Highlight findings that were unexpected or that challenge common assumptions. This section builds credibility — it shows you followed the data rather than confirming a narrative.

```markdown
## Surprises & Outliers

[ANSWER-FIRST] [N] findings contradicted our initial hypotheses or conventional wisdom.

**Surprise 1: [Counter-intuitive finding]**
We expected [expected result], but the data showed [actual result]. [Brief explanation of why this might be the case].

**Surprise 2: [Outlier or anomaly]**
[Description of the outlier and what it might indicate]

[INFO-GAIN: honest reflection on what was unexpected — this demonstrates intellectual rigor and makes the study more trustworthy]

> **What this tells us:** [1-2 sentence meta-insight about what the surprises reveal]
```

**Rules:**
- Include at least 2 surprises or outliers
- Be honest about what contradicted expectations
- Offer a hypothesis for the surprise, but flag it as speculation
- This section is often the most-shared part of a data study

---

### Limitations & Future Research (100-150 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Acknowledge what this study does not cover and what questions remain open.

```markdown
## Limitations & Future Research

- [Question 3]

[STAT: if applicable, reference a related study that addresses one of these gaps]
```

**Rules:**
- This section builds trust — be genuinely transparent
- Distinguish between limitations (things that weaken the findings) and scope boundaries (things outside the study's intent)
- Suggest specific future research directions (you may write those follow-ups)

---

### Implications & Recommendations (200-300 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Translate findings into specific, actionable recommendations for the reader.

```markdown
