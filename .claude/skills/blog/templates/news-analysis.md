# Template: News Analysis (Timely Event Commentary)

**Template ID:** news-analysis
**Target Length:** 800-1,200 words
**Content Type:** Timely event analysis with actionable implications
**Primary Search Intent:** Informational / Navigational ("what happened," "what does X mean," "reaction to")

## When to Use This Template

Use this template when:
- A significant event, announcement, or release has just occurred
- The audience needs fast, opinionated analysis (not just a summary)
- You can publish within 2-4 hours of the event
- Search queries will include the event name + "what it means," "implications," "analysis"
- You have a clear perspective or expertise that adds value beyond the press release

Do NOT use this template for:
- Evergreen how-to content (use tutorial)
- Original research or data studies (use data-research)
- Reference/FAQ content (use faq-knowledge)
- Events more than 2 weeks old (the window for this format has passed)

**Speed Priority:** This template prioritizes speed of publication over depth. Get it out fast, then update if needed.

## Section-by-Section Structure

---

### TL;DR Box (40-60 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Distill the key implications into 2-3 sentences. Focus on what the reader should know and do, not on rehashing the event.

> [audience] are [implication 1] and [implication 2]. [One-sentence recommendation
> or prediction]. [Action to take now].

- Lead with implications, not with what happened
- Include one actionable recommendation
