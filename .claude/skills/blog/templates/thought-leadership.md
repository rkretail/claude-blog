# Template: Thought Leadership

**Description:** Opinion and analysis piece that challenges conventional wisdom with a data-backed contrarian angle. Thought leadership content positions the author as an independent thinker, generates discussion and backlinks, and attracts an engaged audience that values original perspectives.

**Target Word Count:** 1,500-2,500 words

---

## When to Use This Template

- **Content Goal:** Establish the author as an original thinker, spark industry conversation, and earn backlinks through a strong, defensible opinion
- **Search Intent:** Informational with a navigational element (readers seek specific perspectives and analysis, not just facts)
- **Funnel Stage:** Top-of-funnel awareness and brand-building
- **Use When:**
  - You have data or experience that contradicts a widely held belief
  - The mainstream advice on a topic is outdated, oversimplified, or demonstrably wrong
  - You can propose a specific, actionable alternative (not just criticism)
  - You are prepared to defend your position with evidence, not just opinion
  - The topic generates enough debate that a contrarian take will attract attention

## Section-by-Section Structure

---

### Title

**Format:** "Why [Conventional Wisdom] Is Wrong (And What to Do Instead)"

**Alternative formats:**
- "Stop [Common Practice]: [Reason] (Here's What Works Better)"
- "The [Topic] Advice Everyone Gives Is [Problem]. Here's the Data."
- "[Number] Reasons [Popular Belief] Is Holding You Back"

**Guidelines:**
- The title must clearly signal a contrarian position — ambiguity kills click-through
- Include the conventional wisdom being challenged so the reader knows the stakes
- Parenthetical or colon structure works well to deliver both the problem and the promise
- Keep under 65 characters for full SERP display (the parenthetical can extend slightly)

```

[IMAGE] Hero image that visually represents the tension between convention and your alternative. Consider a split-screen concept, a "myth vs. reality" graphic, or a bold typographic treatment of the contrarian claim.

---

### Hook (100-150 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Open with your bold contrarian statement in the very first sentence. Do not build up to it — lead with the punch. The reader should know exactly what you are arguing within 10 seconds.

**Structure:**
1. **Bold contrarian statement** (1-2 sentences): State your position clearly and without hedging. Be specific about what you disagree with.
   - [STAT: data point that supports your opening claim]
2. **Stakes** (1-2 sentences): Why does this matter? What is the cost of following the conventional wisdom?
3. **Credibility hook** (1-2 sentences): Why should the reader listen to you? Cite your experience, data source, or unique vantage point.
4. **Preview** (1 sentence): What will you cover in this piece and what will the reader be able to do differently afterward?

[INFO-GAIN: unique analysis] The opening statistic or claim should be something not commonly cited. If you are using the same data point everyone else uses, you are not yet differentiated.

---

### The Conventional View (200-300 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Fairly and accurately summarize the mainstream position in the first two sentences. Do not strawman — the stronger you present the opposing view, the more credible your critique will be.

**Structure:**
1. **The mainstream position** (2-3 sentences): State what most experts, articles, or practitioners recommend. Cite specific sources if possible.
   - [STAT: data or source supporting the conventional view]
2. **Why it is popular** (2-3 sentences): Explain the logic behind the conventional wisdom — there are usually good historical reasons it became dominant
3. **Where it comes from** (2-3 sentences): Trace the origins — is it based on outdated research, a specific context that has changed, or a misinterpretation of data?
4. **Who advocates for it** (1-2 sentences): Name specific thought leaders, publications, or institutions associated with this view (respectfully)

[INFO-GAIN: unique analysis] Demonstrate that you understand the conventional position deeply. Your critique is only as strong as your representation of what you are critiquing.

[INTERNAL-LINK] If you have previously written content aligned with the conventional view (or a neutral explainer), link to it here for context.

---

### Why This Is Wrong (300-400 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] State the core problem with the conventional view in the first sentence. Then systematically dismantle it with 2-3 specific, evidence-based arguments.

**Structure:**
1. **Core problem statement** (1-2 sentences): The fundamental flaw in the conventional view
2. **Problem 1** (75-100 words):
   - **Claim** (1 sentence): State the specific problem
   - **Evidence** (2-3 sentences): Data, case study, or logical argument supporting your claim
   - [STAT: supporting data point]
3. **Problem 2** (75-100 words):
   - **Claim** (1 sentence): State the second specific problem
   - **Evidence** (2-3 sentences): Different type of evidence than Problem 1 (e.g., if Problem 1 used quantitative data, use a qualitative example here)
   - [STAT: supporting data point]
4. **Problem 3** (75-100 words):
   - **Claim** (1 sentence): State the third specific problem
   - **Evidence** (2-3 sentences): The most compelling evidence saved for last
5. **Synthesis** (1-2 sentences): Tie the three problems together into a coherent critique

[INFO-GAIN: unique analysis] At least one of the three problems MUST be based on original observation — your own data, a pattern you noticed firsthand, or an insight from direct experience. Aggregating other people's arguments is not thought leadership.

[IMAGE] Include a visual that illustrates one of the problems — a failed example, a misleading chart corrected, or a before/after comparison.

---

### What the Data Actually Shows (300-400 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Present your alternative interpretation of the evidence in the first two sentences. Show the reader what changes when you look at the data differently.

**Structure:**
1. **Reframed data** (2-3 sentences): Present the same (or better) data with your alternative interpretation
2. **Counter-examples** (100-150 words): 2-3 specific examples where the conventional approach failed or the alternative approach succeeded
   - [INFO-GAIN: unique analysis] Include at least one example from your own experience or original research
3. **Alternative framework** (100-150 words): Propose a new way of thinking about this topic — a mental model, framework, or decision tree that replaces the conventional one
4. **Supporting evidence** (50-75 words): Additional data points that validate your framework
   - [STAT: original or underreported statistic]

[VISUAL: chart-type] This is the most important visual in the piece. Include a chart, graph, or diagram that makes your case visually compelling. Options:
- A chart showing data that contradicts the conventional view
- A side-by-side comparison of outcomes using conventional vs. alternative approaches
- A framework diagram illustrating your proposed mental model

[INTERNAL-LINK] Link to any supporting data, case studies, or research that deepens the reader's understanding of your alternative view.

---

### The Better Approach (200-300 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Name your alternative approach in the first sentence and state the core principle that makes it different.

**Structure:**
1. **The alternative** (1-2 sentences): Clear statement of what to do instead — be prescriptive, not vague
2. **Core principles** (3-5 bullet points): The key tenets of your approach, each in 1-2 sentences
3. **Why it works** (2-3 sentences): Connect the principles back to the evidence presented in the previous section
4. **Proof point** (2-3 sentences): A specific result achieved using this approach — ideally your own
   - [STAT: result or outcome metric]

[INFO-GAIN: unique analysis] The alternative approach should be original — not just the inverse of the conventional wisdom but a genuinely different way of thinking about the problem.

[INTERNAL-LINK] Link to how-to guides or tutorials that walk the reader through implementing your approach.

---

### How to Apply This (200-300 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Give the reader their first action step in the opening sentence. Transition from theory to practice immediately.

**Structure:**
1. **Immediate action** (1-2 sentences): What can the reader do today to start applying this thinking?
2. **Step-by-step implementation** (numbered list, 3-5 steps):
   - Each step should be specific and actionable (not "think differently about X")
   - Include estimated time or effort for each step
   - Note which steps are quick wins vs. longer-term shifts
3. **Measurement** (1-2 sentences): How will the reader know if the new approach is working? What metrics should they track?
4. **Timeline** (1 sentence): Set realistic expectations for when they will see results

[INFO-GAIN: personal experience] Share a specific detail from when you implemented this approach yourself — what was the first thing you changed and what happened?

[INTERNAL-LINK] Link to tactical how-to articles, tools, or templates that support implementation.

---

### Caveats (100-150 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Acknowledge the most significant limitation of your argument in the first sentence. Intellectual honesty strengthens, not weakens, your position.

**Structure:**
1. **Primary caveat** (1-2 sentences): The biggest exception or limitation to your argument
2. **Context-dependency** (1-2 sentences): Situations where the conventional view may actually be correct
3. **What you might be wrong about** (1-2 sentences): The weakest part of your argument, honestly stated
4. **Nuance** (1 sentence): A bridging statement that acknowledges complexity without abandoning your core position

**Guidelines:**
- Do not hedge so much that your entire argument collapses — this section should be honest but bounded
- Readers respect intellectual honesty more than false certainty
- This section differentiates genuine thought leadership from clickbait hot takes

---

### FAQ (3 questions)

[FAQ] Focus on the most likely objections and follow-up questions a skeptical reader would have.

**Guidelines:**
- Frame questions as pushback: "But doesn't [counter-argument]?"
- Answers should be 40-80 words, direct, and evidence-based
- This is your chance to address objections you did not cover in the main body

```
### But doesn't [conventional approach] work in [specific context]?

[ANSWER-FIRST] [Direct 1-sentence answer acknowledging the valid point.] [2-3 sentences explaining why your approach still applies or how to adapt it for this context.]

### What if I've already invested in [conventional approach]?

[ANSWER-FIRST] [Direct 1-sentence answer.] [2-3 sentences on how to transition without starting over.] [STAT: relevant transition data if applicable.]

### How do you respond to [specific expert or study] that supports the conventional view?

[ANSWER-FIRST] [Direct 1-sentence answer.] [2-3 sentences engaging specifically with that source and explaining the difference in interpretation or methodology.]
```

[INTERNAL-LINK] Link FAQ answers to supporting evidence, case studies, or expanded discussions of these objections.

---

### Conclusion: Call for Industry Shift (100-150 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Restate your core argument in one sentence, then look forward.

**Structure:**
1. **Core argument restated** (1 sentence): The single most important takeaway, stated with conviction
2. **What needs to change** (2-3 sentences): The broader shift you are calling for — not just individual behavior but industry or community norms
3. **Vision of the future** (1-2 sentences): What does the world look like if your approach gains adoption?
4. **Final call to action** (1 sentence): Invite discussion, sharing, or action — end with energy, not a whimper
