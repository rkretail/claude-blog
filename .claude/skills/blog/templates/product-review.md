## Section-by-Section Structure

---

### Title

**Format:** "[Product Name] Review ([Year]): [Key Verdict]"

**Guidelines:**
- Lead with the exact product name (match how people search)
- Year in parentheses signals freshness
- Key verdict is a concise, opinionated summary (e.g., "Still the Best for Teams," "Great Value, Some Tradeoffs," "Not Worth the Hype")
- Keep under 60 characters for full SERP display

```
# [Product Name] Review ([Year]): [Key Verdict]
```

[IMAGE] Hero image of the product in use (your own photo or screenshot, not a press image). Alt text: "[Product Name] — [brief description of what the image shows]."

---

### TL;DR Verdict Box

[ANSWER-FIRST] Deliver the complete verdict upfront. A reader who only sees this box should know exactly whether this product is right for them.

```
> **Verdict:** [Score out of 10] / 10
>
> **One-Line Summary:** [Single sentence capturing the overall assessment]
>
> **Best For:** [Specific type of user or use case, e.g., "Small teams that need async video collaboration"]
>
> **Not Ideal For:** [Who should look elsewhere, e.g., "Enterprise teams needing SSO and audit logs"]
>
> **Pricing:** [Starting price and billing model, e.g., "Free plan available. Paid plans from $12/user/month (billed annually)"]
>
> [STAT: one key metric from your testing, e.g., "Reduced our meeting time by 35% over 3 months"]
```

### Introduction (100-150 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] State what the product does and your overall impression in the first two sentences. Do not start with the company's history.

**Structure:**
1. **What the product does** (1-2 sentences): Clear, plain-language explanation of the product's core function
2. **Why you are reviewing it** (1 sentence): What prompted the review — a common question, reader request, or personal need?
3. **Testing context** (2-3 sentences): How long you used it, in what environment, and for what purpose
4. **Preview of verdict** (1 sentence): A hint at your overall conclusion to keep the reader engaged

[INFO-GAIN: personal experience] Establish credibility by specifying your exact testing conditions — duration, use case, team size, comparison products, etc.

[INTERNAL-LINK] If this product fits within a broader category you have covered (e.g., a roundup or pillar page), link to it here.

### Pros & Cons Table

A quick-scan visual reference before the reader dives into details. This section should be skimmable in under 10 seconds.

```
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| [Pro 1 — specific, not generic] | [Con 1 — specific, not generic] |
| [Pro 2] | [Con 2] |
| [Pro 3] | [Con 3] |
| [Pro 4] | [Con 4 (if applicable)] |
| [Pro 5 (if applicable)] | |
```

**Guidelines:**
- Be specific: "Loads dashboards in under 2 seconds" beats "Fast performance"
- Be honest: Include meaningful cons, not just nitpicks
- Limit to 4-5 items per column for readability

---

### Testing Methodology (100-150 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] State the testing duration and core methodology in the first sentence so the reader can immediately gauge the review's depth.

**Structure:**
1. **Testing duration** (1 sentence): How long you used the product (e.g., "I used [Product] daily for 6 weeks")
2. **Testing environment** (1-2 sentences): Your setup — device, OS, team size, workflow context
3. **What you tested** (2-3 sentences): Which features you focused on and why
4. **Comparison baseline** (1 sentence): What you compared against (previous tool, competitor, manual process)

[INFO-GAIN: personal experience] This section is critical for E-E-A-T. Be as specific as possible about your real testing conditions. Vague claims like "I tried it out" undermine credibility.

---

### Feature Sections (4-6 features, 150-200 words each)

Each feature gets its own H2 section, framed as a question the reader is likely asking.

**For each feature section, use this structure:**

```
## How Good Is [Feature Name]?
```

[ANSWER-FIRST] Open with a 1-sentence verdict on this specific feature before elaborating.

**Structure per section:**
1. **Feature verdict** (1 sentence): Is this feature good, great, mediocre, or lacking?
2. **What it does** (1-2 sentences): Brief explanation for readers who may not know the feature
3. **First-hand observation** (3-5 sentences): Your specific experience using this feature — what worked, what did not, what surprised you
4. **Comparison point** (1-2 sentences): How this compares to an alternative product's version of the same feature
5. **Who cares about this** (1 sentence): Which type of user would weigh this feature most heavily?

[INFO-GAIN: personal experience] Every feature section MUST include at least one specific, first-hand observation. "The search feature returned results in under 500ms even with 10,000+ documents" is strong. "The search feature is fast" is weak.

[IMAGE] Include a screenshot or screen recording demonstrating the feature in use. Annotate screenshots to highlight the relevant UI element.

[STAT: performance metric or comparison data point] Quantify your experience wherever possible (load times, error rates, time savings, etc.).

**Repeat this structure for each of the 4-6 feature sections.**

---

### Pricing & Value (150-200 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] State whether the product is good value for money in the first sentence, then break down the details.

**Structure:**
1. **Value verdict** (1 sentence): Is it worth the price?
2. **Plan breakdown** (table or list):

```
| Plan | Price | Key Features | Best For |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Free | $0 | [Features] | [Use case] |
| Pro | $X/mo | [Features] | [Use case] |
| Enterprise | Custom | [Features] | [Use case] |
```

3. **Hidden costs** (1-2 sentences): Are there add-ons, overage charges, or required integrations that increase the real cost?
4. **Value comparison** (1-2 sentences): How does pricing compare to the closest competitor?
5. **Recommendation** (1 sentence): Which plan makes the most sense for most users?

[STAT: cost comparison or ROI data] Include a concrete cost comparison or ROI calculation if possible.

[INTERNAL-LINK] Link to a dedicated pricing comparison article or alternatives roundup if one exists.

---

### Alternatives (100-150 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Name the top alternative in the first sentence along with the primary reason someone might choose it instead.

**Structure:**
List 2-3 alternatives, each with:

```
### [Alternative 1 Name]
**Best if you need:** [Specific differentiator, e.g., "better enterprise security features"]
**Price:** [Starting price]
**Key difference:** [One sentence on how it compares to the reviewed product]

### [Alternative 2 Name]
**Best if you need:** [Specific differentiator]
**Price:** [Starting price]
**Key difference:** [One sentence comparison]

### [Alternative 3 Name]
**Best if you need:** [Specific differentiator]
**Price:** [Starting price]
**Key difference:** [One sentence comparison]
```

[INTERNAL-LINK] Link each alternative to its own dedicated review if one exists. Link to a comparison article (e.g., "[Product] vs [Alternative]") if available.

---

### Final Verdict (100-150 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Restate the overall score and verdict in the opening sentence. Do not make the reader work to find your recommendation.

**Structure:**
1. **Score and one-line verdict** (1 sentence): Repeat the verdict from the TL;DR box for readers who scrolled to the end
2. **Strengths summary** (1-2 sentences): The 1-2 things this product does exceptionally well
3. **Weaknesses summary** (1-2 sentences): The 1-2 most significant shortcomings
4. **Clear recommendation** (2-3 sentences): State exactly who should buy this and who should not. Use conditional language: "If you [specific need], [Product] is [verdict]. If you [different need], consider [Alternative] instead."

[INFO-GAIN: personal experience] End with a personal note — would YOU continue using this product? Why or why not?

---

### FAQ (3-5 questions)

[FAQ] Source questions from People Also Ask results, product forums, Reddit threads, and common pre-purchase questions.

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on purchase-decision questions (not general category questions — save those for the pillar page)
- Each answer should be 40-80 words and lead with a direct answer
- Include at least one pricing question and one comparison question

```
