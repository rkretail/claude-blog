## Section-by-Section Structure

---

### Title

**Format:** "The Complete Guide to [Topic] in [Year]"

**Guidelines:**
- Include primary keyword naturally
- The year signals freshness and improves CTR
- Keep under 60 characters for full SERP display

```

[IMAGE] Hero image that visually represents the topic. Use a custom graphic or high-quality photo — not a generic stock image. Alt text should include the primary keyword.

---

### TL;DR Box (40-60 words)

```
