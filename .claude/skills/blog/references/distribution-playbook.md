# Content Distribution Strategy -- Playbook for AI Visibility

88-92% of AI citations come from off-site signals, not on-page optimization
alone (Seer Interactive, 2025). This playbook covers channel-by-channel
distribution tactics to maximize both traditional search rankings and AI
citation rates.

**Budget allocation**: 40% owned content / 60% earned media and distribution.
Most companies allocate 90/10 -- this is wrong for GEO. Off-site presence
is the dominant factor in whether AI systems cite your content.

## Reddit (Highest Growth Channel for AI Visibility)

### Why Reddit Matters for AI
- Reddit visibility in AI citations grew 450% (1.30% to 7.15%)
- Google's $60M annual API deal surfaces Reddit content in AI training
- 7,702 of 10,000 keyphrases show "Discussions and Forums" SERP features
- 2.2-21% of AI Overview citations by query type come from Reddit
- 77% of keyphrases with product reviews show Discussion features in SERPs

### Subreddit Research Methodology

1. **Find active communities** (target 5-10 subreddits in your niche):
   - Search Reddit directly: `site:reddit.com [your niche] subreddit`
   - Check subreddit sidebar for rules, posting guidelines, and related subs
   - Use `redditlist.com` or `subredditstats.com` for activity metrics
   - Look for subs with 10K-500K members (sweet spot for engagement vs noise)

2. **Evaluate each subreddit before participating**:

   | Check | What to Look For |
   |-------|-----------------|
   | Self-promotion rules | Most subs require max 10% self-promotional content |
   | Post types allowed | Some ban links entirely; others require text posts |
   | Active moderators | Dead subs provide no value |
   | Comment quality | High-quality discussions = higher AI citation chance |
   | Flair requirements | Some subs require specific post flair |

3. **Observe before posting**: Spend 1-2 weeks reading and commenting
   before submitting any content. Understand what gets upvoted, what gets
   removed, and the community's tone.

### Reddit Content Strategy

**Self-promotion rules**: Maximum 10% of your activity should be your own
content. For every 1 promotional post, you need 9 genuine contributions
(comments, answers, discussions).

**Format that works on Reddit**:
- Lead with an insight or question, not a link
- Share specific data points and findings in the post body
- Provide standalone value -- the post should be useful without clicking any link
- Place your blog link in context within the post, not as the sole purpose
- Use formatting: bold for key stats, bullet points for lists, TL;DR at top

**Example post structure**:
```
Title: [Specific finding] -- [context/data point]

TL;DR: [2-3 sentence summary with key stats]

[Paragraph 1: The insight or finding with data]

[Paragraph 2: Why this matters / what it means]

[Paragraph 3: What you can do about it]

I wrote a more detailed breakdown here: [link] -- but the key takeaways
are all above.

[Paragraph 4: Ask a question to drive discussion]
```

### Thread Mining for Long-Tail Keywords

Reddit threads surface in Google's "Discussions and Forums" SERP feature.
Mine existing threads for content ideas:

1. Search: `site:reddit.com [your topic] "how do" OR "what is" OR "best way"`
2. Find recurring questions with no authoritative answer
3. Write blog posts that answer these questions with data
4. Answer the Reddit thread with a genuine, helpful response (link optional)

This creates a flywheel: Reddit thread ranks for the query, your comment
adds value, your blog post becomes the authoritative source.

## YouTube (Strongest AI Visibility Correlation)

### Why YouTube Matters for AI
- 0.737 correlation with AI visibility (strongest signal in Ahrefs 75,000-brand study)
- Citations in AI Overviews up 414% (Q1 2025, BrightEdge)
- How-to video citations up 651%
- Visual demo citations up 592%
- 200x more cited than any other video platform
- YouTube is the second-largest search engine globally

### Companion Video Structure

Mirror your blog's H2 sections as video chapters. This creates cross-platform
topical authority that AI systems recognize.

| Blog Section | Video Chapter | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Introduction | 0:00 Hook + overview | Match blog's opening stat |
| H2 Section 1 | Chapter 1 | Same data points, visual explanation |
| H2 Section 2 | Chapter 2 | Show charts/data on screen |
| H2 Section 3 | Chapter 3 | Demo or walkthrough if applicable |
| FAQ | Q&A Chapter | Answer the same FAQ questions |
| Conclusion | Summary + CTA | Link to blog in description |

### Title Optimization
- Match the blog title format closely (builds topical association)
- Include the target keyword within the first 60 characters
- Keep total length under 70 characters
- Use numbers when possible: "5 Ways...", "2026 Data Shows..."
- Front-load the value: "[Key Finding]: How to [Achieve Outcome]"

### Transcript SEO
YouTube auto-captions are approximately 85% accurate. Always upload your own
transcript for perfect accuracy:

1. Export transcript from your blog post (strip formatting)
2. Add timestamps matching video chapters
3. Upload via YouTube Studio > Subtitles > Add Language > Upload File
4. Verify accuracy and keyword presence

**Why transcripts matter**: AI systems index video transcripts. Keywords in
your transcript directly influence AI citation likelihood. An accurate
transcript with proper keyword usage is a ranking signal.

### Thumbnail Best Practices

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| Colors | Contrasting colors (complementary palette), avoid YouTube red |
| Text | Maximum 4 words, large readable font (even on mobile) |
| Face | Close-up with expressive emotion (increases CTR 30-40%) |
| Consistency | Use brand template for recognizable channel identity |
| Resolution | 1280x720 minimum, 16:9 aspect ratio |
| File size | Under 2MB (YouTube compresses further) |

### YouTube Description Template
```
[First 2 lines appear before "Show more" -- use them wisely]

[Key stat from blog] -- in this video, I break down [topic].

Chapters:
0:00 Introduction
1:30 [Chapter 1 title]
4:00 [Chapter 2 title]
...

Read the full blog post: [URL]

Resources mentioned:
- [Resource 1]: [URL]
- [Resource 2]: [URL]

#keyword1 #keyword2 #keyword3
```

### Video Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Length | 10+ minutes | Longer videos get more AI citations |
| Retention | 50%+ average | Signals quality to YouTube algorithm |
| CTR | 5%+ | Indicates compelling title/thumbnail |
| Upload frequency | 1-2/week | Consistent publishing builds authority |

---

## LinkedIn

### Content Adaptation
Adapt blog posts for LinkedIn as shorter articles (800-1,200 words).
LinkedIn audiences prefer opinion-led, personal, and industry-relevant content
over keyword-optimized SEO content.

### Format Guidelines

| Element | LinkedIn Optimization |
|---------|----------------------|
| Length | 800-1,200 words (shorter than blog) |
| Tone | Personal, opinion-led, first-person |
| Paragraphs | 1-2 sentences each (very short) |
| Emphasis | **Bold text** for key phrases and stats |
| Lists | Bullet points for scannable takeaways |
| Closing | Ask a question to drive comments |
| Links | Put external links in the FIRST COMMENT, not the body |

### Why First Comment for Links
LinkedIn's algorithm suppresses posts containing external links in the body.
Posts with external links get 30-50% less reach than text-only posts. Place
your blog link as the first comment immediately after publishing.

### Thought Leadership Positioning

| Content Type | Purpose | Frequency |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Contrarian takes | Challenge industry assumptions with data | 1-2/month |
| Industry analysis | Break down trends and what they mean | 2-4/month |
| Lessons learned | Share failures and successes transparently | 1-2/month |
| Data snapshots | Share one compelling stat with analysis | Weekly |
| Frameworks | Original models or processes | Monthly |

### Posting Schedule
- **Best times**: 7-8 AM or 12 PM (local timezone of your audience)
- **Critical window**: Engage with every comment within the first hour
- LinkedIn's algorithm evaluates engagement velocity in the first 60 minutes
- Reply to comments with substantive responses, not just "thanks"

### LinkedIn Post Template
```
[Hook line with surprising stat or contrarian statement]

[1-2 sentence context or personal connection]

Here's what the data shows:

- [Key finding 1 with stat]
- [Key finding 2 with stat]
- [Key finding 3 with stat]

[2-3 sentences of analysis -- your unique take]

[What this means for the reader -- actionable insight]

[Question to drive engagement]

---
[Hashtags: #topic1 #topic2 -- max 3-5]
```

---

## Twitter / X

### Thread Format
Convert blog posts into Twitter threads (7-9 tweets) for maximum reach:

**Thread structure**:
1. **Hook tweet**: Most surprising finding + promise of value
2-7. **Insight tweets**: One key insight per tweet with standalone value
8. **Summary tweet**: Key takeaway recap
9. **CTA tweet**: Link to full blog post + retweet request

### Tweet Optimization

| Guideline | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Hook tweet | Must stop the scroll -- use a surprising stat or counterintuitive claim |
| Insight tweets | Each must deliver value independently |
| Stats per tweet | Include one specific data point |
| Length | 200-280 characters per tweet (not maximum, but substantive) |
| Hashtags | Maximum 2 per tweet, use niche hashtags over broad ones |
| Media | Add an image or chart to 2-3 tweets in the thread |
| CTA | Clear and specific: "Read the full breakdown" not "check it out" |

### Thread Template
```
Tweet 1 (Hook):
[Surprising stat]. [What it means in one sentence].

Here's what the data reveals (and what to do about it):

🧵👇

Tweet 2-7 (Insights):
[Number]. [Finding]

[Supporting stat] ([Source]).

[Why it matters in 1-2 sentences].

Tweet 8 (Summary):
Key takeaways:

1. [Finding 1]
2. [Finding 2]
3. [Finding 3]

Tweet 9 (CTA):
Full breakdown with all the data and charts:

[Blog URL]

If this was useful, retweet the first tweet so others can find it.
```

### Hashtag Strategy
- Use niche hashtags that your target audience follows (e.g., `#SEOdata`, `#AISearch`)
- Avoid broad hashtags that get lost (e.g., `#marketing`, `#AI`)
- Research active hashtags: search the hashtag, check tweet frequency and quality
- Maximum 2 hashtags per tweet to avoid looking spammy

## Review Platforms (B2B)

### Why Reviews Drive AI Citations
- Multi-platform review presence gives 2.6-3.5x citation multiplier
  (Authoritas, 2025)
- G2 accounts for 22-23% of review-platform citations
- 33% of all review citations come from G2
- Companies with profiles on 3+ platforms: 4.6-6.3 citations vs 1.8
  without (2.6-3.5x multiplier)

### Platform Priority (B2B)

| Platform | Citation Share | Priority |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| G2 | 22-23% of review citations | Critical |
| Capterra | 15-18% | High |
| TrustRadius | 10-12% | High |
| Gartner Peer Insights | 8-10% | Medium |
| Trustpilot | Consumer-focused | If B2C |

### Profile Optimization Checklist

| Element | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Company description | Keyword-rich, 250-500 words, mirrors website positioning |
| Product categories | Select all relevant categories (increases discoverability) |
| Screenshots | 5-10 product screenshots with descriptive captions |
| Logo | High-resolution, matches website branding |
| Pricing info | Keep current (outdated pricing hurts trust) |
| Integration list | Link all integrations/partnerships |
| Comparison pages | Claim and optimize vs-competitor pages |

### Review Generation Strategy
- Ask customers at high-satisfaction moments (post-onboarding, after milestone)
- Make the process frictionless: provide direct links to review forms
- Respond to every review (positive and negative) within 48 hours
- Negative review responses demonstrate transparency (E-E-A-T signal)
- Goal: maintain 4.0+ rating across all platforms
- Volume: 50+ reviews per platform for credible presence

## Wikipedia and Wikidata

### Why Wikipedia Matters
- 22% of AI training data comes from Wikipedia
- 7.8% of all ChatGPT citations reference Wikipedia
- Used as a "credibility tiebreaker" when AI sources conflict
- Wikidata Q-IDs strengthen entity recognition in Knowledge Graph

### Strategy
Wikipedia requires notability established through independent, reliable
sources. You cannot create a Wikipedia page for self-promotion.

**Pathway to Wikipedia presence**:
1. Get covered by 3-5 independent reliable sources (news outlets, industry publications)
2. Ensure coverage is substantive (not just mentions)
3. Create a Wikidata entry for your organization (lower notability bar)
4. If notable, an independent editor may create a Wikipedia article
5. Never edit your own Wikipedia page -- this violates Wikipedia policy

### Wikidata Entry
```
Entity: [Organization Name]
Instance of: Q4830453 (business enterprise) or Q7397 (software)
Official website: [URL]
Founded: [Date]
Industry: [Q-ID for your industry]
```
