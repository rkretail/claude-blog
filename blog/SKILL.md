# Blog -- Content Engine for Rankings & AI Citations

Full-lifecycle blog management: strategy, briefs, writing, analysis, optimization,
and editorial planning. Dual-optimized for Google's December 2025 Core Update
and AI citation platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews).

## Quick Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/blog write <topic>` | Write a new blog post from scratch |
| `/blog rewrite <file>` | Rewrite/optimize an existing blog post |
| `/blog analyze <file-or-url>` | Audit blog quality with 0-100 score |
| `/blog brief <topic>` | Generate a detailed content brief |
| `/blog calendar [monthly\|quarterly]` | Generate an editorial calendar |
| `/blog strategy <niche>` | Blog strategy and topic ideation |
| `/blog update <file>` | Update existing post with fresh stats and sources |

## Orchestration Logic

### Command Routing

1. Parse the user's command to determine the sub-skill
2. If no sub-command given, ask which action they need
3. Route to the appropriate sub-skill:
   - `write` → `blog-write` (new articles from scratch)
   - `rewrite` → `blog-rewrite` (optimize existing posts)
   - `analyze` / `audit` → `blog-analyze` (quality scoring)
   - `brief` → `blog-brief` (content briefs)
   - `calendar` / `plan` → `blog-calendar` (editorial calendars)
   - `strategy` / `ideation` → `blog-strategy` (positioning and topics)
   - `update` → `blog-rewrite` (with freshness-update mode)

### Platform Detection

Detect blog platform from file extension and project structure:

| Signal | Platform | Format |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `.mdx` files, `next.config` | Next.js/MDX | JSX-compatible markdown |
| `.md` files, `hugo.toml` | Hugo | Standard markdown |
| `.md` files, `_config.yml` | Jekyll | Standard markdown with YAML front matter |
| `.html` files | Static HTML | HTML with semantic markup |
| `wp-content/` directory | WordPress | HTML or Gutenberg blocks |
| `ghost/` or Ghost API | Ghost | Mobiledoc or HTML |
| `.astro` files | Astro | MDX or markdown |

Adapt output format to detected platform. Default to standard markdown if unknown.

## Core Methodology -- The 6 Pillars

Every blog post targets these 6 optimization pillars:

| Pillar | Impact | Implementation |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Answer-First Formatting | +340% AI citations | Every H2 opens with 40-60 word stat-rich paragraph |
| Real Sourced Data | E-E-A-T trust | Tier 1-3 sources only, inline attribution |
| Visual Media | Engagement + citations | Pixabay/Unsplash images + SVG charts via `/svg` |
| FAQ Schema | +28% AI citations | Structured FAQ with 40-60 word answers |
| Content Structure | AI extractability | 50-150 word chunks, question headings, proper H hierarchy |
| Freshness Signals | 76% of top citations | Updated within 30 days, dateModified schema |

## Quality Gates

These are hard rules. Never ship content that violates them:

| Rule | Threshold | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Fabricated statistics | Zero tolerance | Every number must have a named source |
| Paragraph length | Never > 100 words | Split or trim |
| Heading hierarchy | Never skip levels | H1 → H2 → H3 only |
| Source tier | Tier 1-3 only | Never cite content mills or affiliate sites |
| Image alt text | Required on all images | Descriptive, includes topic keywords naturally |
| Self-promotion | Max 1 brand mention | Author bio context only |
| Chart diversity | No duplicate types | Each chart must be a different type |

## Scoring Methodology

Blog quality is scored across 6 categories (100 points total):

| Category | Weight | What it measures |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Content Quality | 25 pts | Readability, paragraph length, sentence length, information gain |
| Answer-First Formatting | 20 pts | Stat-first H2 openers, direct answers, question headings |
| Statistics & Citations | 20 pts | Source count, tier quality, attribution format |
| Visual Elements | 15 pts | Image count, chart count/diversity, distribution |
| Schema & Structure | 10 pts | FAQ schema, BlogPosting schema, heading hierarchy |
| Freshness & Trust | 10 pts | Update date, author E-E-A-T, brand mentions |

### Scoring Bands

| Score | Rating | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 90-100 | Excellent | Publish as-is |
| 75-89 | Good | Minor tweaks needed |
| 60-74 | Needs Work | Significant improvements required |
| < 60 | Poor | Full rewrite recommended |

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

| Anti-Pattern | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| Fabricate statistics | December 2025 Core Update penalizes unsourced claims |
| Use the same chart type twice | Visual monotony, reduces engagement |
| Keyword-stuff headings or meta | Google ignores/penalizes this |
| Bury answers in paragraphs | AI systems extract from section openers |
| Skip source verification | Broken links and wrong data destroy trust |
| Use tier 4-5 sources | Low authority hurts E-E-A-T |
| Generate without research | AI-generated consensus content is penalized |
| Skip visual elements entirely | Blogs with images get 94% more views |
