# SEO Landscape 2026 -- Google Updates & E-E-A-T

## December 2025 Core Update

Ran December 11-29, 2025 (18 days). Google's official statement: "designed to better
surface relevant, satisfying content." Rewarded authentic first-hand experience and
penalized "fake freshness." 71% of affiliate sites without original testing were
negatively impacted. E-E-A-T requirements expanded beyond YMYL to ALL competitive queries.

### Authenticity Signals Google Evaluates

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Original images/video | Not stock photos — real screenshots, photos, demos |
| Specific language | Details only direct experience provides |
| First-person perspective | "When we tested this..." "In our experience..." |
| Original data | Proprietary surveys, case studies, experiments |
| Build-in-public docs | Process documentation, behind-the-scenes |

### What Gets Penalized
- Articles that read like "summaries of top five search results"
- Mass-produced AI content lacking human oversight
- Content without unique perspective or original information

### Key Clarification
John Mueller (November 2025): "Our systems don't care if content is created by AI or
humans. What matters is whether it's helpful for users." AI as research tool is fine
— AI as sole content creator without expertise is not.

### SISTRIX Analysis -- Winners & Losers

Post-December 2025 core update visibility shifts (SISTRIX data):
- Sites with original testing, case studies, and first-hand experience gained visibility
- 71% of affiliate sites without original testing lost rankings
- E-E-A-T expanded beyond YMYL to ALL competitive queries — this is the biggest shift
  since E-A-T was introduced
- Winners share a common trait: unique data or perspectives AI cannot replicate
- Losers overwhelmingly produced "consensus content" — rewritten summaries of existing
  top results with no original contribution

### Quality Rater Guidelines Updates

**September 2025 QRG Update:**
- Added AI Overview evaluation criteria — raters now assess AI-generated summary accuracy
- Expanded YMYL definitions to cover broader range of topics affecting wellbeing
- Key principle codified: "Trust is the most important member of the E-E-A-T family"

**January 2025 QRG Update:**
- First formal "generative AI" definition added to the guidelines
- Scaled content abuse explicitly flagged — mass AI generation without human oversight
  marked as lowest quality
- Raters instructed to evaluate whether AI-generated content demonstrates genuine
  expertise or merely mimics it

## E-E-A-T Framework (Extended December 2025)

**Critical**: December 2025 core update extended E-E-A-T to ALL competitive queries,
not just YMYL.

| Factor | Weight | Key Signals |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Experience | 20% | First-hand knowledge, original content, case studies |
| Expertise | 25% | Credentials, depth, technical accuracy |
| Authoritativeness | 25% | Industry recognition, citations, reputation |
| Trustworthiness | 30% | Contact info, transparency, security (most important) |

### YMYL Topics (Highest Scrutiny)
Health, finance, legal, news, elections, democratic processes, groups of people.

### AI Content Assessment (Sept 2025 QRG)
- AI content acceptable IF it demonstrates genuine E-E-A-T
- Low-quality AI markers: generic language, no unique insights, regurgitated facts

## Hidden Gems Ranking System

Now fully integrated into core ranking (not Helpful Content System).
Identifies content from forums, social media, niche blogs where people share
"first-hand knowledge and personal insights."

- 77% of keyphrases with product reviews show "Discussions and Forums" SERP feature
- 7,702 of 10,000 keyphrases show "Discussions and Forums" features (Hidden Gems data)
- Perspectives filter replaced by "Forums" filter (March 2024)
- User-generated content (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram) appears in carousels

## Structured Data 2026

### Active (Recommend Freely)
- BlogPosting, Article
- Organization, LocalBusiness
- FAQPage (keep answers 40-60 words)
- BreadcrumbList
- Person (author credentials)
- Product, SoftwareApplication
- AggregateRating, Review

### Deprecated (Never Recommend)
- HowTo (Sept 2023)
- SpecialAnnouncement (July 2025)
- Practice Problem, Dataset for general search, Sitelinks Search Box, Q&A (Jan 2026)

### Critical Technical Note
Schema must appear in HTML source, not injected via JavaScript.
Most AI crawlers cannot execute JS. 72% of first-page results use schema markup.

## Google AI Overviews & AI Mode

### Coverage
- AI Overviews appear in 49% of SERPs (across all query types)
- 15-21% global (conservative) to 60% US queries (Advanced Web Ranking, Nov 2025)
- Doubled from 6.49% (Jan 2025) to 24.61% peak (July 2025), stabilized ~15.69%

### Traffic Impact (Seer Interactive, 3,119 queries, 42 orgs)
- Organic CTR declined 61% with AI Overviews (1.76% → 0.61%)
- Paid CTR declined 68% (19.7% → 6.34%)
- Even without AI Overviews: 41% organic CTR decline
- BUT: brands cited in AI Overviews see 35% higher organic CTR, 91% higher paid CTR

### AI Mode (Separate Product)
- 120 countries, 100 million monthly users
- 300-word average responses (vs 157 for AI Overviews)
- 12.6 links per response (vs 9.26)
- 93% zero-click rate
- Gemini 3 default model (Jan 27, 2026)

## Market Context

- Google market share below 90% for first time since 2015 (87.3%)
- ChatGPT: 800M weekly users, 2.5B daily queries
- AI referral traffic: 1.08% of all web traffic, grew 527% (Jan-May 2025)
- Zero-click searches: 58-60%, projected 65-70% by mid-2026
- Gartner: 25% decline in traditional search volume by 2026 (appears accurate)
- B2B SaaS discovery search declined 70-80% as buyers use AI assistants instead

## Agentic Commerce & AI Advertising

Emerging trends reshaping search monetization:

- **ChatGPT Agent**: Autonomous web browsing, form-filling, purchasing on user's behalf
- **Google Unified Commerce Platform (UCP)**: Single campaign type across Search, Shopping,
  YouTube, Maps — replacing fragmented campaign management
- **AI Overview Ads**: Sponsored placements in AI Overviews grew from 1% to 25% of queries;
  projected to reach 50%+ by end of 2026
- **ChatGPT shopping traffic**: 11.4% conversion rate vs 5.3% organic search
  (Search Engine Journal)
- **Perplexity**: Launched sponsored answers (Nov 2024, $50+ CPM), paused new
  advertisers (Oct 2025); OpenAI confirmed ad testing in ChatGPT during 2026
- **Implication for blogs**: Content must be structured for AI agent extraction (clear
  pricing, specs, comparisons) as agentic commerce bypasses traditional click paths

## AI Content Prevalence in Search

- 17.31% of top 20 search results contain AI-generated content (icoda.io)
- AI-generated content is now embedded across all verticals, not just low-quality niches
- Google's systems evaluate quality regardless of origin — but the sheer volume of AI
  content raises the bar for differentiation through original research and experience

## AMP Deprecation

AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) is effectively dead:
- Squarespace deprecated AMP support in February 2025
- Google removed AMP as a Top Stories ranking requirement in 2021
- No SEO benefit to AMP implementation — Core Web Vitals replaced AMP's purpose
- Recommendation: Remove AMP versions if maintaining them creates overhead; focus on
  native page speed optimization instead
