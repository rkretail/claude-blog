# Content Structure Rules -- Dual Optimization

## Answer-First Formatting (+340% AI Citation Improvement)

The most impactful single optimization. Every H2 section must open with a
40-60 word paragraph that:

1. Contains at least one specific statistic with source attribution
2. Directly answers the heading's implicit question
3. Uses natural, conversational language

### Pattern
```markdown
## How Does X Impact Y in 2026?

[Stat] ([Source](url), year). [Direct answer in 1-2 more sentences, explaining
the implication for the reader. Keep this opening paragraph to 40-60 words total.]
```

### Why It Works
AI systems extract answers from section openers. If your answer is buried in
paragraph 3 of a section, it will not be cited. Lead with the answer, then
explain.

## Heading Hierarchy

### Rules
- ONE H1 per page (the title only)
- H2s for main sections (target 6-8 per post)
- H3s for subsections — never skip levels (no H1 → H3)
- Include primary keyword naturally in 2-3 headings

### Question-Format Headings
Convert 60-70% of H2s to questions:
- "The Future of X" → "What Does X Look Like in 2026?"
- "Strategies for Y" → "How Do You Achieve Y in 2026?"
- Keep 2-3 statement headings for variety

### Why Questions Work
AI systems directly extract answers following question formats. Search engines
show these in People Also Ask. Users scan headings as questions they want answered.

## Paragraph Rules

| Parameter | Target | Hard Limit |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Paragraph length | 40-55 words | Never > 100 words |
| Sentence length | 15-20 words | Occasional longer OK |
| Extractable chunks | 50-150 words | For AI citation |

### Key Principle
Start each paragraph with the most important sentence. This enables both
readers and AI to grasp concepts by scanning.

## Readability Targets

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Flesch Reading Ease | 60-70 | Grade level 8-10, accessible to general audience |
| Flesch-Kincaid Grade | 8-10 | Not too simple, not too academic |
| Language style | Conversational | Mirrors how people ask questions |

AI systems prefer natural, conversational language. But readability alone
doesn't determine AI citation — content must also demonstrate expertise
and provide unique value.

## Content Length Guidelines

| Content Type | Target Length | Minimum |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Pillar guide | 3,000-4,000 words | 2,500 |
| Standard blog post | 2,000-2,500 words | 1,500 |
| Comparison post | 1,500-2,000 words | 1,200 |
| FAQ/listicle | 1,500-2,000 words | 1,000 |
| News/update | 800-1,200 words | 600 |

Long-form (2,000+ words) gets 3x more AI citations than short posts.

## Information Gain -- The Key Differentiator

Google's 2022 patent promotes content based on uniqueness. AI can synthesize
consensus but cannot create new data. Optimize by:

1. **Original research**: Surveys, proprietary data, experiments
2. **Personal perspective**: Opinions AI cannot replicate
3. **Expert interviews**: Practitioners with first-hand knowledge
4. **Case studies**: Real metrics and results
5. **Process documentation**: "Building in public" content

B2B SaaS websites conducting original research saw 25.1% average increase
in top-10 rankings (Stratabeat study).

## Meta Description Formula

Pattern: "[Key statistic]. Here's how [strategy] delivers [outcome] in 2026."

Rules:
- 150-160 characters
- Include one specific statistic
- No keyword stuffing
- End with value proposition or call to action
- Fact-dense, not vague

## Citation Format

### Inline Attribution (Preferred)
```markdown
Organic CTR declined 61% with AI Overviews ([Seer Interactive](url), 2025).
```

### Study Reference
```markdown
The Princeton GEO paper (KDD 2024) established that GEO methods boost
AI visibility by up to 40%.
```

### Quote Attribution
```markdown
John Mueller clarified in November 2025: "Our systems don't care if content
is created by AI or humans."
```

## Citation Tier System

### Tier 1: Primary Authority (Highest Trust)
Google Search Central, government agencies, .edu, international organizations,
W3C, standards bodies.

### Tier 2: Primary Data (Research & Studies)
Ahrefs, SparkToro, Seer Interactive, BrightEdge, Princeton GEO Paper,
Semrush Sensor, Advanced Web Ranking, Kevin Indig, Digitaloft, Onely, Seenos.

### Tier 3: Trusted Journalism
Search Engine Land, Search Engine Journal, Search Engine Roundtable,
The Verge, Wired, TechCrunch.

### Tier 4-5: AVOID
SEO tool blogs (non-research), affiliate sites, content mills, unsourced
roundups, AI-generated content farms. These hurt E-E-A-T.

## Self-Promotion Rules

- Maximum 1 brand mention per post (author bio context only)
- Remove "At [Company], we..." patterns
- Remove promotional links to own products
- Convert sales language to educational content
- Author section should demonstrate E-E-A-T credentials, not sell

## Internal Linking

- 5-10 internal links per 2,000-word post
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Link to related content naturally within context
- Ensure bidirectional linking (pillar ↔ supporting pages)
