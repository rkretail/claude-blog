# Blog Strategy -- Positioning & Content Architecture

Develops comprehensive blog strategies that build topical authority for
Google rankings while establishing brand presence for AI citation platforms.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Discovery

Gather context through questions or project analysis:

1. **Business**: What do you sell/do? Who are your customers?
2. **Blog goals**: Traffic? Leads? Authority? AI citations?
3. **Current state**: Existing blog content? (scan if project available)
4. **Competitors**: Who are your 3-5 main competitors?
5. **Differentiator**: What unique expertise or data do you have?
6. **Resources**: Writing capacity (posts/week), budget for visuals?

### Step 2: Competitive Landscape

Research competitors' blogs:
1. WebSearch for competitor blog URLs
2. For each competitor, assess:
   - Publishing frequency
   - Content types (guides, case studies, comparisons, news)
   - Visual quality (images, charts, videos)
   - Schema usage
   - Social distribution (YouTube, Reddit, LinkedIn)
   - AI citation presence (search ChatGPT/Perplexity for industry terms)
3. Identify gaps no competitor covers well

### Step 3: Audience Mapping

Define 2-3 audience segments:

```
### Audience Segment: [Name]
- **Role**: [Job title / description]
- **Pain points**: [What problems do they have?]
- **Search behavior**: [What do they Google?]
- **AI behavior**: [What do they ask ChatGPT/Perplexity?]
- **Content preferences**: [Long guides? Quick answers? Video?]
- **Buying stage**: [Awareness / Consideration / Decision]
```

### Step 4: Content Pillar Design

Design 3-5 content pillars based on audience needs and competitive gaps:

```
### Pillar: [Topic Area]
- **Purpose**: Build authority in [topic]
- **Primary keywords**: [3-5 keywords]
- **Content types**: Pillar guide, supporting posts, comparisons, FAQ
- **Unique angle**: [What first-hand experience/data can you provide?]
- **Estimated posts**: [N] to achieve topic coverage
- **AI citation potential**: [High/Medium/Low] — [why]
```

### Step 5: Differentiation Strategy

The January 2026 Authenticity Update rewards first-hand experience. Plan
how to demonstrate genuine expertise:

| Signal Type | Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|
| Original data | Conduct surveys, analyze proprietary data, run experiments |
| Case studies | Document real client/project results with metrics |
| Build in public | Share process, learnings, and failures transparently |
| Expert interviews | Feature practitioners with first-hand knowledge |
| Tool reviews | Test products personally, share screenshots and results |
| Industry analysis | Provide unique perspective on public data |

### Step 6: Distribution Channel Strategy

AI visibility requires off-site presence (88-92% of AI citations come
from off-site signals). Plan brand presence:

| Channel | AI Impact | Strategy |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| YouTube | 0.737 correlation (strongest) | Companion videos for pillar posts, how-tos, demos |
| Reddit | 450% citation surge | Authentic participation in 3-5 subreddits, share insights not links |
| Review platforms | 2.6-3.5x citation multiplier | Maintain profiles on G2, Capterra, TrustRadius (B2B) |
| Wikipedia/Wikidata | Credibility tiebreaker | Build notability through earned media, create Wikidata entry |
| Industry publications | Tier 2-3 citation source | Guest posts, expert commentary, study contributions |
| Social media | Brand mentions | LinkedIn thought leadership, Twitter/X insights |

Budget allocation recommendation: **40% owned content / 60% earned media and distribution**.

### Step 7: Measurement Framework

```
### Metrics to Track

#### Traditional SEO
- Organic traffic (monthly)
- Keyword rankings (top 10, top 3)
- Domain authority / Domain Rating
- Internal link coverage
- Core Web Vitals

#### AI Citation Metrics (New)
- Share of Voice in ChatGPT responses (manual tracking)
- AI Overview citation rate (Google Search Console)
- Perplexity mentions (manual tracking)
- AI referral traffic (GA4: source contains chatgpt, perplexity, claude)
- Brand mention volume (branded search + web mentions)

#### Content Quality
- Blog quality score via `/blog analyze` (target: 80+)
- Content freshness (% of posts updated within 30 days)
- Visual element coverage (charts + images per post)
- Citation tier quality (% tier 1-3 sources)

#### Business Impact
- Blog-attributed leads/conversions
- Email subscribers from blog
- Content-assisted revenue
```
