# Blog Brief Generator -- Content Planning

Generates comprehensive content briefs that guide blog writing for maximum
impact on both Google rankings and AI citation platforms.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Topic Intake

Gather from the user:
1. **Topic or keyword** (required)
2. **Target audience** (who reads this?)
3. **Search intent** — Informational, commercial, transactional, navigational
4. **Business context** — What does the company do? What's the CTA?

If only a topic is given, infer the rest from context.

### Step 2: Keyword Research

Using WebSearch:
1. Search for the target keyword — analyze what currently ranks
2. Identify **primary keyword** (exact match target)
3. Identify **3-5 secondary keywords** (related terms, long-tail)
4. Identify **3-5 question queries** (People Also Ask style)
5. Note the **search intent** — what do searchers actually want?

### Step 3: Competitive Analysis

Analyze the top 3-5 ranking pages for the target keyword:
1. **Content length** — What's the average word count?
2. **Heading structure** — How many H2s? What topics do they cover?
3. **Visual elements** — Do competitors use charts, images, videos?
4. **Content gaps** — What do all competitors miss?
5. **Freshness** — How recently were they updated?
6. **Schema** — Do they use FAQ or other rich results? (Note: HowTo deprecated Sept 2023)

### Step 4: Statistics Research

Find 8-12 statistics the article should include:
1. Search: `[topic] study 2025 2026 data statistics research`
2. Prioritize tier 1-3 sources
3. For each stat, record: value, source, URL, date, methodology
4. Identify 2-4 stats suitable for chart visualization

### Step 5: Generate the Brief

Output format:

```
